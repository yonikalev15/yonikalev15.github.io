# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Yoni Kalev and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 05

Lab 05: In part one of this lab, I got to use modular programming to code a program that
computes the area of a rectangle using its length and width. This was my first time using
multiple files to code something, which was interesting. I also liked part two because I
got to use static_cast to convert integers to doubles and doubles to integers. Using this,
I converted a decimal number of feet to inches and feet.

* Lab 08

Lab 08: I enjoyed part one as I wrote functions that compute the average mean of every element
in a vector except the highest and lowest values. I also found part two interesting as I got to
use multiple loops to form patterns. This lab especially helped me improve my loop-writing skills.

* Lab 12

Lab 12: I liked part one because I got to use RGB to create animations for the first time. Part
two was also interesting because we got to use pseudorandom number generators. This lab helped me
learn how to use both of these things properly.
